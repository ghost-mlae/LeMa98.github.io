Hi everyone. I'm currently a PhD student at [Luojia-Spatial Computer Research Group](http://www.luojia-spatial.com/articles.html) led by Academician [Huayi Wu](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/why/index.html), School of [State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing(LIESMARS)](https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/), The Wuhan University ([WHU](https://www.whu.edu.cn/)), starting at Sep 2022. And I am undergoing a two-year co-op at [Integrated Sustainability Analysis Laboratory](https://isa.org.usyd.edu.au/index.html), The University of Sydney ([USYD](https://www.sydney.edu.au/)), starting at Dec 2023. I feel very much fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Manfred Lenzen](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=E_CfsPYAAAAJ&hl=de), Prof. [Longgang Xiang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/xianglonggang/zh_CN/index.htm), Prof. [Huayi Wu](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/why/index.html), and [Chao Wang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/wangchao/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests include Spatial-Temporal Data Mining, Carbon emission, GIS models. In general, I'm always highly interested in Urban Sustainability Modeling and Analysis. 

Before that, I obtained my Master Degree from Wuhan University, School of LIESMARS. My Master's research was carried out in the [Geospatial Awareness and Intelligent Services] lead by Academician [Nengcheng Chen](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/chennengcheng/). I was lucky to be supervised by Prof.[Chao Wang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/wangchao/zh_CN/index.htm)
