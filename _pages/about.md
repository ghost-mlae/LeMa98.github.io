Short Bio
======
Hi everyone. I'm currently a PhD student at [Data & Knowledge Research Group](https://unswdb.github.io/index.html), School of [CSE](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering), The University of New South Wales (UNSW) [UNSW](), starting at January 2024. I was awarded the highly competitive UIPA PhD scholarship (Presidential Scholarship) from UNSW. I feel very much fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=yHTJo1kAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Adelle Coster](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/adelle-coster). My research interests include Spatial-Temporal Data Mining, Big Data Management, Data-Driven Autonomous Driving, Graph Neural Networks,V2X Technology, and Generative AI Models. In general, I'm always highly interested in the machine-learning foundation theory, application of heterogeneous data mining, and AI+X technologies. 

Before that, I obtained my Master Degree from Zhejiang University, School of CSE in June 2023. My Master research was carried out in the [State Key Lab. of Industrial Control Technology](http://nesc.zju.edu.cn/#/member/faculty) lead by Academician Youxian Sun. I was lucky to be supervised by Prof. [Shibo He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5GOcb4gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and co-supervised by Prof. [Jiming Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zK9tvo8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Changjiang Scholars Chair Professor, IEEE Fellow, Vice President of Zhejiang University of Technology).

Before joining UNSW as a PhD student, I spend half-year's time working at the frontier of autonomous driving industry in Shenzhen. During my tenure as a Senior R&D Algorithm Engineer in BYD Autonomous Driving Technology R&D Centre, Dept. of IDA, Shenzhen China, I was lucky to be lead by Jie Liao(廖杰), the former Autonomous Driving R&D Chief Director from Horizon Robotics, and worked closely with Dr. Wei Dong. 

Aside from that, I'm also a blogger in Bilibili.com, where I tend to record my daily life in University as a research student, and share some experience about scientific research.
